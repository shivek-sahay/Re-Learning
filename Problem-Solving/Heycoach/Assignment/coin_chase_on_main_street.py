Coin Chase on Main Street
In the lively town of Main Street, two HeyCoach students, Ram and Shyam, embarked on an intriguing challenge. Tasked by their mentor, they ventured onto a straight road lined with an even number of buildings. Each building held a stash of gold coins, but here's the twist â€“ certain buildings were occupied by cunning thieves who could pilfer coins from their pockets.

Ram kicked off the adventure from the 0th building, while Shyam began at the (n-1)th building, both determined to maximize their gold haul. Guided by their mentor's strategy, they aimed to visit n/2 buildings, ensuring they'd eventually meet in the middle.

You have to return an array of size `n/2` where ith index would denote who has the maximum number of coins collected at ith time.


if Ram has maximum coins, -1 if Shyam has maximum coins, 0 if both have same number of coins.

Example 1

Input: [1,2,-1,4,-1,1]   

Output: [0,1,-1]
Example 2

Input: [1,-1]   

Output:  [1]
Example 3

Input:  [2,2,2,2]   

Output: [0,0]
Constraints

2 <= n <= 200000

n is even

-1e^9 <= coins[i] <= 1e^9
