Divide the Array with Minimum Cost
You are given an array of integers nums of length n.
The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.
You need to divide nums into 3 disjoint contiguous subarrays.

Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.

Input Format:
First line of input contains a single integer n (3<=n<=100)
Second Line of input contains n integers A1, A2,...., An (1<=A[i]<=1000)
Output Format:
You have to print the minimum possible sum of the cost of the 3 subarrays.

Sample Input
4
1 2 3 12
Sample Output
6
